#Sam and Apple are similar in popularity among girls, as they are very
# unconventional names, and Apple only started appearing after the 1970s,
# predictably more popular among  hippie/non-conformist parents. Sam as a name
# for boys sees a steady decline after 1960, which is the same time as the near
# exponential increase of non-conformity among all baby names mentioned in
# question 5.
